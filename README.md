    <h1>Neural Network From Scratch</h1>
</div>

This neural network consists of a simple recognition of decimal digits, in order to learn the fundamental of theory and logic behind a neural networks, this model was implemented only with mathematic and linear algebra, the only extra library used was [Numpy](https://numpy.org/).

To achieve this goal the the famous [MNIST digt recognizer dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer) was used in this project.
